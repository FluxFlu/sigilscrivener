# Sigil Scrivener

> This project is inspired by [Sigil Scribe](https://www.sigilscribe.me/).

Sigil Scrivener is a program takes text and transforms it into a sigil.

## Examples

```
$ sigilscrivener Example sentence.

Will Received: Example sentence.

Interpreting syllables: (IZB UCC LLV)

O (2, 2) (3, 1) <| (2, 1) (3, 3) <| (1, 1) (2, 1) |
```

The program then creates a sigil in the form of a `sigil.pbm` file, which can then be converted into any given ordinary image type (such as `.png`).
